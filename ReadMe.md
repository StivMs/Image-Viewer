## Knowledge

A few things I've learned during this project:

* Loading images from folder and adding the path to an array
* Knowledge about how cell and rows works in a tableView
* Moving from one scene to another with data (sending over image and data to another scene/view)
* Saving images to gallery via share button and getting access to gallery (permisson)


## Acknowledgments

Majority of the knowledge are from the "Hacking with Swift" - course
